I love Thai yellow curry with peanuts, mostly anything ethnic is great food.
Besides homework, my favorite activity is reading fantasy novels and web serials.
MIS seems to be a great blend between data, business, programming, and the future. I believe it will provide enough of a foundation for me to enter the working field and further my career.
